## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is P2P Universal VPN really free?**
A: Yes, the software is completely free and open-source under the MIT license.

**Q: Can I use this VPN to access geographically restricted content?**
A: As this is a P2P VPN and does not use exit servers in different countries, it is not ideal for bypassing geographical restrictions. Its main purpose is to create secure private networks between devices.

**Q: How many devices can I connect in a single network?**
A: Theoretically, there is no hard limit, but we recommend up to 50 devices to maintain optimal performance. For larger networks, consider creating multiple sub-networks.

**Q: How does NAT traversal work?**
A: The application implements multiple NAT traversal techniques, including UDP hole punching, STUN, TURN, and relays, automatically selecting the best option to establish the connection.

**Q: What is the difference between kernel and userspace modes?**
A: Kernel mode offers better performance but requires support in the operating system kernel. Userspace mode is more compatible, working on virtually any system, but with a slight performance reduction.

**Q: Is my data stored on any server?**
A: No, P2P Universal VPN does not store any data on servers. All configurations are stored locally on your device.
